NOTE: I manually added column headers for the attributes and labels in my downloaded datasets, 
with that my code won't run without having those column headers. So, please run the code from
my cloned repo instead of placed the Python files and shell script into a folder with datasets
without column headers.

1. Clone Repo into your terminal using git clone <url>
2. Run code using sh run.sh terminal command
3. Code will display results for the carData and bankData sets for varying tree sizes.
